# Contributing to [svelte-movable][github]

Thank you for stopping by. [svelte-movable][github] welcomes and appreciates your contribution

## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue, [first search for existing issues][github.issues] to avoid duplications.

When you start working on an issue, make sure you are asked to be assigned to it.

### Bug Report

Please include as much details as possible:

- steps to reproduce,
- a github repo that has enough setup to reproduce the bug would be nice,
- screenshots.

### Feature Request

If you have an idea and don't know where to start yet, consider [opening a discussion][github.discussions] first.

If you have a PR ready as your proposed implementation, you can [create an issue][github.issues] and a PR that references it.

## Pull Requests

Each pull request should [reference an open issue][github.issues.open] unless the change is very something simple such as a typo.

## Consistent Code Style

1. Commit message should follow the [Conventional Commits specification][conventionalcommits], this will enable [semantic-release][semanticrelease] to automate the workflow properly.
2. Code should be formatted with [prettier] and linted with [eslint]. They are already integrated into the codebase. See [package.json] for relevant scripts. There might also exist extensions for your editor that further enhance the experience with these tools.
   - [VS Code Prettier][vscode.extension.prettier]
   - [VS Code Eslint][vscode.extension.eslint]
